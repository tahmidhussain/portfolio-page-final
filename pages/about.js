          I would describe myself as someone who is quite creative, I am
          passionate about videography and photography. My favourite film is The
          Truman Show (odd I know). I would also I like to say I stay active as
          I play multiple sports and practice some martial arts. I enjoy
          travelling and have visited over 20 countries.{" "}
